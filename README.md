# Predicting House Sales Using Linear Regression
---
#### Data Analysis Techniques Used:
- Reading Data Sets
- Cleaning Data
- Finding Correlation
- Building a Machine Learning Model using SciKit
- Testing the Model with the Data

#### Overview:
This project introduces the housing prices dataset and an exercise to accurately predict the sale price of a house. As a culmination of this module’s topics, in the final project for this module, I was challenged to improve on this analysis and create my own, more accurate, linear regression model.

Your challenge in this project is to improve Dr. Williams’ results by choosing different variables in the dataframe to create your model. Your project submission must include an analysis of at least three additional variables and offer other solutions that improve the results. 

#### Files Included:
I have included the Jupyter Notebook for the project as well as a slide deck presentation showcasing the results from the project.
